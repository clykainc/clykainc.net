With a driver's championship battle still up for grabs, midfield teams fighting for millions of dollars in prize and bonus money, and some drivers racing to stay on the grid in 2026. Lots of storylines converged at La Capital so let's run through it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"nordic-h3\">Verstappen's Historic Late Season Title Bid</div>\n<div class=\"nordic-card\">\n<p>The biggest conversation coming into Mexico surrounded Max Verstappen and his historic late season surge to put him in contention to win his 5th title. Coming into this weekend Max Verstappen had won 3 out of the last 4 grand prix (Monza, Baku, and Austin) including a sprint victory where both McLaren drivers DNF after colliding into turn one. In fact since coming out of the summer break in late August the dutchman has yet to not reach the podium in the last 6 races with 3 P1 finshes, 2 P2's and a P3 in Mexico this past weekend (sorry for the spoiler...)</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><em><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/www.formula1points.com-season-progression-2025.com-season-progression-2025-3.com season progression 2025\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"></figure></em></p>\n<p class=\"align-right\"><span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\"><em>courtesy of formula1points.com</em></span></p>\n<p>Max is no stranger to making the unthinkable happen, and this year is no exception. After the Dutch GP Max sat 104 points behind the points leader Oscar Piastri. Since that race Verstappen has outscored Oscar Piastri 116:47 and closed the gap to just 36 points the lead with just 4 races to go. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"font-size: inherit; outline: rgba(16, 137, 255, 0.55) solid 3px !important;\" src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-xs.webp 300w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-sm.webp 480w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<p>After Red Bull dismissed long time team principal Christian Horner half way through the year the team all but seemed to be in an identity crisis -  a situation the Milton Keynes based team had yet to face since this<span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> current ruleset went into place.

How would the Australian driver fair in Mexico City when the pressure of a Verstappen bid has gotten to an uncomfortable distance of becoming a reality. The driver who had been so dominate and consistent weekend to weekend through this long season has had people scratching their heads as of late.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"outline: rgba(16, 137, 255, 0.55) solid 3px !important;\" src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/www.formula1points.com-season-head-to-head.com-season-head-to-head.com - season head-to-head\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"625\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-right\"><span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\"><em>courtesy of formula1points.com</em></span></p>\n<p>Excluding the outliers of Zandvoort, Baku and when Oscar gave the position back to Lando in Monza. Norris since the British Grand Prix (Round 12) has beat his teammate 4:1 in race results and has also improved to tie Oscar this season after lackluster qualifying woes earlier on in the season to 10:10. Oscar who has commented that the off-season he worked on his qualifying and single lap pace has been a focal point of his ability to lead the championship since April of this year in Saudi Arabia. In an era where qualifying and clean air is king - especially for the aero on the McLaren car.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-xs.webp 300w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-sm.webp 480w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<div class=\"nordic-h3\">Fresh Faces in FP1</div>",
