Coming into this weekend Max Verstappen had won 3 out of the last 4 grand prix (Monza, Baku, and Austin) including a sprint victory where both McLaren drivers DNF after colliding into turn one. In fact since coming out of the summer break in late August the dutchman has yet to not reach the podium in the last 6 races with 3 P1 finshes, 2 P2's and a P3 in Mexico this past weekend (sorry for the spoiler...)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><em><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/www.formula1points.com-season-progression-2025.com-season-progression-2025-3.com season progression 2025\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"></figure></em></p>\n<p class=\"align-right\"><span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\"><em>courtesy of formula1points.com</em></span></p>\n<p>Max is no stranger to making the unthinkable happen, and this year is no exception.

Since that race Verstappen has outscored Oscar Piastri 116:47 and closed the gap to just 36 points the lead with just 4 races to go. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"font-size: inherit; outline: rgba(16, 137, 255, 0.55) solid 3px !important;\" src=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-xs.webp 300w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-sm.webp 480w ,https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<p>After Red Bull dismissed long time team principal Christian Horner half way through the year the team all but seemed to be in an identity crisis -  a situation the Milton Keynes based team had yet to face since this<span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> current ruleset went into place.

How would the Australian driver fair in Mexico City when the pressure of a Verstappen bid has gotten to an uncomfortable distance of becoming a reality.

Norris since the British Grand Prix (Round 12) has beat his teammate 4:1 in race results and has also improved to tie Oscar this season after lackluster qualifying woes earlier on in the season to 10:10. Oscar who has commented that the off-season he worked on his qualifying and single lap pace has been a focal point of his ability to lead the championship since April of this year in Saudi Arabia.

The track which is one of the shortest on the calendar in terms of distance - 830m, presents itself with plenty of challenges for teams to navigate throughout the weekend. The track sits at a calendar high 2,285 meters altitude which means that air density is 20.7% lower than at sea level.This lower air density means less downforce, lower grip, and the car can feel on the edge throughout the entire lap. With the longest straight down to turn one teams should opt for less draggy setups but because of the aforementioned thin air forces constructors to run higher than normal downforce set ups. Big braking zone in the first sector of the lap can be tricky to nail. The kerbs if taken incorrectly can unsettle and ruin the entire lap.Holding pole position isn’t a guarantee through lap one. The long straight going into turn one is notorious for picking up massive slipstreams, as well as the curb and exit into another straight down into turn 4. In addition to the lower than normal down-force less air density means that both engine and brake cooling tend to be very marginal at Mexico.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"nordic-quote\">\n<blockquote>That makes obviously a big difference for the downforce and for the cooling. So in terms of downforce, you have a lot less downforce compared to a normal track at sea level altitude, which means that you slide a lot more. And then for the cooling, it's a lot more difficult to actually cool the brakes, the engine. It's very difficult</blockquote>\n<div class=\"author\">Charles Leclerc</div>\n</div>",
