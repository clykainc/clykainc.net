            "content_html": "<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>Vamos! </strong></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Round 20 of the 2025 F1 season took us inside to The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriquez for the Grand Prix's 10th Anniversary as the season makes way for the final 5 tracks of year. With a driver's championship battle still up for grabs, midfield teams playing for millions of dollars in prize and bonus money for the constructors who stand highest, and some drivers racing to stay on the grid in 2026. Lots of storylines converged at <em>La Capital </em>so let's run through it. </p>\n<p>The biggest conversation coming into Mexico surrounded Max Verstappen and his historic late season surge to put him in contention to win his 5th title. Coming into this weekend Max Verstappen had won 3 out of the last 4 grand prix (Monza, Baku, and Austin) including a sprint victory where both McLaren drivers DNF after colliding into turn one. In fact since coming out of the summer break in late August the dutchman has yet to not reach the podium in the last 6 races with 3 P1 finshes, 2 P2's and a P3 in Mexico this past weekend (sorry for the spoiler...)</p>\n<p>Max is no stranger to making the unthinkable happen, and this year is no exception. After Red Bull dismissed long time team principal Christian Horner half way through the year the team all but seemed to be in an identity crisis -  a situation the Milton Keynes based team had yet to face since this current ruleset went into place. Newly Appointed team Principal Laurent Mekkies has done a marvelous job of steering the team back on track as they are eyeing for a hotly contested P2 in the constructors championship with Verstappen closing in on the driver's title as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
