Coming into this weekend Max Verstappen had won 3 out of the last 4 grand prix (Monza, Baku, and Austin) including a sprint victory where both McLaren drivers DNF after colliding into turn one.

The track which is one of the shortest on the calendar in terms of distance - 830m, presents itself with plenty of challenges for teams to navigate throughout the weekend. The track sits at a calendar high 2,285 meters altitude which means that air density is 20.7% lower than at sea level.This lower air density means less downforce, lower grip, and the car can feel on the edge throughout the entire lap. With the longest straight down to turn one teams should opt for less draggy setups but because of the aforementioned thin air forces constructors to run higher than normal downforce set ups. Big braking zone in the first sector of the lap can be tricky to nail. The kerbs if taken incorrectly can unsettle and ruin the entire lap.Holding pole position isn’t a guarantee through lap one. The long straight going into turn one is notorious for picking up massive slipstreams, as well as the curb and exit into another straight down into turn 4. In addition to the lower than normal down-force less air density means that both engine and brake cooling tend to be very marginal at Mexico.</p></div><div class="nordic-quote"><blockquote>That makes obviously a big difference for the downforce and for the cooling. So in terms of downforce, you have a lot less downforce compared to a normal track at sea level altitude, which means that you slide a lot more. And then for the cooling, it's a lot more difficult to actually cool the brakes, the engine. It's very difficult</blockquote><div class="author">Charles Leclerc</div></div><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://clykainc.net/tags/gradient/">Gradient</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://clykainc.net/authors/clay/" title="Clay">Clay</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://clykainc.net/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
