With a driver's championship battle still up for grabs, teams up and down the paddock ffighting for millions of dollars in prize money and some drivers racing to just stay on the grid in 2026. Lots of storylines converged at <em>La Capital </em>so let's run through it.</p></div><hr class="nordic-line"><h2 class="nordic-heading"><span style="color: #000000;">The</span> <span style="color: #ba372a;">Narratives</span></h2><div class="spotlight-box"><h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--nord1);">Verstappen's Historic Late Season Title Bid</h3><p>The biggest conversation coming into Mexico surrounded Max Verstappen and his historic late season surge to put him in contention to win his 5th title. Coming into this weekend Max Verstappen had won 3 out of the last 4 Grand Prix (Monza, Baku, and Austin) in addition to claiming a sprint victory where both McLaren drivers DNF after colliding into each other into turn one. In fact since coming out of the summer break in late August the dutchman has yet to not reach the podium in the last 6 races with 3 P1 finshes, 2 P2's and a P3 in Mexico this past weekend (sorry for the spoiler...)</p><figure class="post__image"><em><img loading="lazy" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/www.formula1points.com-season-progression-2025.com-season-progression-2025-3.com season progression 2025" alt="" width="750" height="500"></em></figure><p></p><p class="align-right"><span style="color: #f1c40f;"><em>courtesy of formula1points.com</em></span></p><p>Max is no stranger to making the unthinkable happen, and this year is no exception. After the Dutch Grand Prix, Max handsomly sat 104 points behind the championship leader Oscar Piastri. Since that race Verstappen has outscored Oscar Piastri 116:47 and closed the gap to just 36 points the lead with just 4 races to go. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" style="font-size: inherit; outline: rgba(16, 137, 255, 0.55) solid 3px !important;" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13.webp" alt="" width="750" height="500" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-xs.webp 300w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-sm.webp 480w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/verstappen-mexico-gp-6909a8725ae13-md.webp 768w"></figure><p>After Red Bull dismissed long time team principal Christian Horner half way through the year the team all but seemed to be in an identity crisis. On the brink to giving up on this year just after the summer break, <span style="font-size: inherit;">Laurent Mekies and the engineers at Milton Keynes have done a marvelous job of steerin</span><span style="font-size: inherit;">g the team back on track as they stand just 9 points from P2 in the constructors. The team has made the executive decision to invest more time and resources into their 2025 car while teams like Williams and McLaren have since moved onto their 2026 project. Whether that will be a consequence will remain to be seen next year, but it has provided Max an oppurtunity to fight each weekend against McLaren.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/20251024-0109-68fc7a62d5a50.webp" alt="" width="750" height="501" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/20251024-0109-68fc7a62d5a50-xs.webp 300w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/20251024-0109-68fc7a62d5a50-sm.webp 480w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/20251024-0109-68fc7a62d5a50-md.webp 768w"></figure></div><div class="spotlight-box-red"><h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--nord1);">Oscar's Late Season Woes</h3><p>On the other end of the discussion was the concern over Oscar Piastri's recent downturn of performance. The major question lingering in the air coming into Mexico was: how would the Australian driver fair in Mexico City when the pressure of a Verstappen bid has gotten to an uncomfortable distance of becoming a reality? The driver who had been so dominate and consistent weekend after weekend through this long season has had people scratching their heads as of late.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" style="outline: rgba(16, 137, 255, 0.55) solid 3px !important;" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/www.formula1points.com-season-head-to-head.com-season-head-to-head.com - season head-to-head" alt="" width="750" height="625"></figure><p class="align-right"><span style="color: #f1c40f;"><em>courtesy of formula1points.com</em></span></p><p>Excluding the outliers of Zandvoort, Baku and when Oscar gave the position back to Lando in Monza because of team orders, Norris since the British Grand Prix (Round 12) has beat his teammate 4:1 in race results. In addition, Lando also improved to tie Oscar this season after lackluster qualifying woes earlier on in the season which now reads 10:10 between the two papaya drivers. Oscar who has went on record to say that this off-season he worked on devloping his qualifying and single lap pace, has leveled the qualifying playfield against his teammate which was just 3-24 coming into this year. In an era where qualifying and clean air is king - especially for the aero on the MCL39 car, Oscar needed a big win going into Mexico.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836.webp" alt="" width="750" height="500" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-xs.webp 300w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-sm.webp 480w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/8bb4cf4fc98f5ffd504013866ed6aa9201018836-md.webp 768w"></figure></div><div class="spotlight-box"><h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--nord1);">Fresh Faces in FP1</h3><p>A handful of new faces and some old faces took to the opening practice session per the F1’s rules. 9 out of the 10 teams fielded an alternative driver Friday with the exception of Sauber. <strong>Pato O Ward - McLaren, Fred Vesti - Mercedes, Antonio Fuoco - Ferrari, Arvid Lindblad, Luke Browning - Williams, Jack Crawford - Aton Martin, Ryo Hirakawa - Haas, Ayumu Iwasa - RB, Paul Aron - Alpine. </strong>Out of all the rookies, Arvid Lindblad made the best impression on paper driving hot laps on softs in the session of evolving track evolution to top all the drivers making their appearance in P6.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/Arvid-Lindblad-Red-Bull-.webp" alt="" width="750" height="422" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/Arvid-Lindblad-Red-Bull--xs.webp 300w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/Arvid-Lindblad-Red-Bull--sm.webp 480w, https://clykainc.net/media/posts/6/responsive/Arvid-Lindblad-Red-Bull--md.webp 768w"></figure><p>Per the new 2025 changes to the rules, the FP1 requirement has expanded. Teams must now run rookies in two FP1 sessions per car, totaling four sessions across the season. Laurent Mekies made it a point to praise the 18 year old after a stressful yet successful FP1 in Max Verstappen's car.</p><div class="nordic-quote"><blockquote><p>We took the decision to leave Arvid on low-ish fuel to not give him the complication of high and low fuel," said "He did a very good job. It's so difficult to jump in. The pace is there, so not much to argue against that.</p></blockquote><div class="author">Laurent Mekies</div></div></div><hr class="nordic-line"><h2 class="nordic-heading">The Track Specifics</h2><div class="nordic-card"><p>Mexic is a unique track which presents many challenges for all teams to navigate throughout the weekend. It is one of the shortest on the grid, has the longest straight down into turn one on the calendar - 830 m, and sits at the highest elevation compared to every other race. In fact, the track sits as high as 2,285 meters altitude which means that air density is 20.7% lower than that at sea level. Lower air density means less downforce, lower grip, and the car can feel on the edge throughout the entire lap. While teams would conventionally go with a low to medium drag setups on tracks such as Mexico, the inconvience of the elevated altitude means that teams have to run higher downforce configurations to prevent unsettling the car throughout the course of a lap. Pair this with expansive braking zones in the first sector—demanding pinpoint precision on entry and exit—alongside a blend of low-, medium-, and high-speed corners throughout sectors 2 and 3, and you have a track where stringing it all together poses a formidable challenge for even the top drivers. Holding pole position isn’t a guarantee through lap one either. The long straight into Turn 1 is notorious for delivering massive slipstreams to rivals tucked in behind, while a sloppy exit onto the following straight down to Turn 4 can leave you wide open to an attack. To top it all off the lower than normal down-force less air density means that both engine and brake cooling tend to be very marginal at Mexico and require additional attention between teams and their technical staff at all times.</p></div><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://clykainc.net/tags/gradient/">Gradient</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://clykainc.net/authors/clay/" title="Clay">Clay</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://clykainc.net/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
